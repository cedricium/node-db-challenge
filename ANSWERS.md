1. Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.

Relation databases are databases that store their data in tabular form, grouped
into rows and columns similar to spreadsheets.

SQL or Structured Query Language is like the code used to communicate or inter-
act with a database.

2. Why do tables need a primary key?

Tables need primary keys in order to uniquely identify each row or piece of data
in that table.

3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on
another table?

Foreign key.

4. What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two
tables?

For a many-to-many relationship, we need a intermediary table.
